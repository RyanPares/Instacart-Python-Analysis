 Data manipulation & Visualization with Python

# Introduction
Instacart stakeholders are particularly interested in the diversity of customers in their database and their purchasing behaviours. They recognize that a one-size-fits-all approach won't work and are contemplating a targeted marketing strategy. They aim to reach different customer segments with tailored marketing campaigns to assess their impact on product sales. Your analysis will guide this strategy, ensuring Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
